# Database API Gen 

### Goals 

- Generate a basic REST CRUD service and OpenAPI spec from an existing MYSQL database schema
- Load sample data into the database and provide a local test environment using Docker compose

### Dependencies 

- [Entgo](https://entgo.io/)
- MySQL 8.x
- OpenAPI 3.x
- Docker

### Data

Leveraged data from [https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db](https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db), but made a few changes to table names to default to singular naming and also added `id` columns to every table especially those with composite primary keys because the Entgo framework does not seem to support this quite yet (see: [https://github.com/ent/ent/issues/400(https://github.com/ent/ent/issues/400)]).

### Running

```bash
# bootstrap the DB and schema in ./schemas
make database-start 

# generate Ent schema/model from db (Docker required)
# generate openapi spec and service from schema 
make build

# run service on localhost:3000
make run

# stop db
make database-stop
```

Generated spec in: [./ent/openapi.json](./ent/openapi.json)

#### Examples

Example:

```bash
‚ùØ curl -s -X 'GET' \
  "http://localhost:3000/employees" \
  -H 'accept: application/json'|jq
